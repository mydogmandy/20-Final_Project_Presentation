# "Initial Analysis" Folder houses files that were used to run our initial analysis and to make feature selection, learn about our data, plan our technology process and provide schema/tables/joins in sql.

# ACCIDENTS.sql is one table created in SQLite.

# OCCUPANTS.sql is the 2nd table created in SQLite.

# CRASH_COMBINED_2.sql is the joined table created in SQLite.

# Crash_Version_2.ipynb is where analysis was run to decide on the Machine Learning model we planned to use for our data set.

# Pandas_profile_Crash.ipynb was our very first data analysis tool used on our data. The correlations produced by Pandas Profile were used in feature selection and gain a deeper understanding of our data.

# mock_ERD_image.png was created to illustrate our database plan including our tables and relationships between the tables.

# mock_schema.sql & mock_schema.txt both have a list of our schema in .SQL and .txt

# technology.md is a list of the technology we intended to use in the planning stages of the project. The final version of the technology used is in our Google Slides presentation and the Requirements.txt file in the Master Branch.

# raw_data.csv is our initial, complete raw data used in our initial analysis.
